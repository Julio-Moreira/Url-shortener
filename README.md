# URL shortener

The *URL shortener program* is a tool that allows users to shorten long, unwieldy URLs into much shorter and more manageable ones. This program works by accepting a long URL from a user and then generating a unique shortened URL that redirects to the original URL when clicked.

The program also include additional features such as **analytics**, which allows users to track the number of clicks and other information about their shortened URLs, and include **QR-code generator**. The program may also include **security** features to prevent malicious users from exploiting the system.

Overall, an *URL shortener program* is a powerful tool for **simplifying long URLs** and making them easier to share and manage. With its ability to generate unique, short URLs, track analytics and generate QR-codes, it is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to manage multiple URLs and track their performance online.

## Usage
The working of API program involves a backend database that stores the original long URLs and their shortened counterparts. When a user inputs a URL, the program generates a new shortened URL by assigning it a unique identifier and then storing it in the database. The program then returns the shortened URL to the user, who can then use it to access the original URL.
