## Abilities
In this project i put all of my studies from **symfony** in practice using _controllers_, _routers_, _sending async emails_, _generating gr-codes_, _authenticating users with JWT_ and more!
I also put all my knowledge in **doctrine** and php into practice in addition to learning an entire testing framework in a short time
Other than that, I also had to learn a bit of **sqlite**/**postgresql** for using databases and learn how to use swagger to generate **my documentations**

### Technologies
For this project I use: 
1. **[php](https://www.php.net)** with **[symfony](https://symfony.com)** for code APIs
2. **[pest](https://pestphp.com)** for tests of app
3. **[swagger](https://swagger.io)** for documentation
4. **[sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org)** for tests and development database
5. **[postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)** for production database
